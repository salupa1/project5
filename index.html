            <h2>$10,000 Every Day You Survive In The Wilderness</h2>
            <p>
                This video is about two strangers, Hayes and Grizz, who are dropped in the wilderness by MrBeast. They are given $10,000 every day they survive. The challenge is to see how long they can last.  In the beginning, they are excited and optimistic. They work together to find food and shelter. They build a fire and gather supplies.  As time goes on, the challenge becomes more difficult. They run out of food and have to find new sources. They argue with each other and Hayes gets frustrated.  At one point, Hayes even steals Grizz's flare gun, which they can use to end the challenge and go home.  Grizz convinces Hayes to stay, and they eventually decide to work together as a team. They build a more permanent shelter and learn to fish. After 74 days, they decide to end the challenge and go home. They have won $670,000.

            <p> 
                The video is about a competition where 100 people compete for a prize of $500,000. The last person standing in a circle wins the prize. The contestants are not allowed to leave the circle or touch a red line around it. If they do, they are eliminated. The video is divided into two parts. In the first part, the circle slowly shrinks over time and the contestants are challenged with various tasks to get them out of the circle. For example, they have to play rock paper scissors, dodge a soccer ball, and answer trivia questions.

            <h2>Survive 100 Days Trapped, Win $500,000</h2>
            <p> The video is about two strangers, Susie and Bailey, who are locked in an isolation chamber for 100 days. If they can survive the entire time, they will split $500,000. The video documents their experience and the challenges they face. In the beginning, they are given basic supplies and have no contact with the outside world. They donâ€™t even know what day or time it is.  The isolation starts to get to them and they struggle to find ways to entertain themselves. The person who created the challenge offers them temptations throughout the 100 days. For example, on day 10, they are offered a private chef for $50,000. They decide to decline the offer. Later, they are offered a chance to buy comfortable beds and turn off the bright lights for $50,000. They accept this offer. At the very end, they are given a chance to double their money to $360,000, but only if they both choose to split the money. If they both choose to steal, they will get nothing. They both choose to split and win the challenge.</p>
